## 1. Introduction & Vision

TransactEasy is a modern, AI-enhanced B2B transaction platform designed to simplify and automate cross-border trade for importers and suppliers. Our vision is to create a seamless, transparent, and intelligent ecosystem where businesses can manage invoices, payments, and digital wallets with unparalleled ease and security. By leveraging AI for smart insights and ensuring a frictionless user experience, TransactEasy aims to become the go-to platform for international trade finance management.

## 2. User Roles & Personas

The platform is designed for three primary user roles:

*   **Importer**: A business entity that purchases goods or services from international suppliers.
    *   **Needs**: View incoming invoices, track payment status, manage digital wallets in multiple currencies, and make secure payments.
    *   **Pain Points**: Complex payment processes, lack of visibility into transaction history, managing multiple currency accounts.

*   **Supplier**: A business entity that sells goods or services to international importers.
    *   **Needs**: Create and send professional invoices, track invoice status (unpaid, paid, overdue), receive payments securely, and leverage AI to optimize pricing and payment terms.
    *   **Pain Points**: Chasing late payments, determining fair pricing, creating and managing invoices manually.

*   **Admin**: An operator of the TransactEasy platform.
    *   **Needs**: Oversee all platform activity, manage user and organization accounts, resolve disputes, and manage platform-level liquidity by crediting/debiting user wallets.
    *   **Pain Points**: Lack of a centralized dashboard to manage the platform's health and user base.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1. User Authentication (Firebase)

*   **User Stories**:
    *   As a user, I want to sign in by selecting my role (Importer, Supplier, Admin) to quickly access my dashboard.
    *   As a user, I want my session to be persisted securely so I don't have to log in every time.
    *   As a user, I want to log out securely, terminating my session.

### 3.2. Role-Based Dashboards
*   **Description**: Each user role will have a tailored dashboard providing at-a-glance information relevant to their needs.
*   **User Stories**:
    *   As an **Admin**, I want to see platform-wide statistics like total transaction volume, number of active users, and pending invoices.
    *   As an **Importer/Supplier**, I want to see my current wallet balance, the number and value of pending invoices, and a summary of recent transactions.

### 3.3. Invoice Management
*   **Description**: A comprehensive system for creating, viewing, and managing invoices.
*   **User Stories**:
    *   As a **Supplier**, I want to create a new invoice by filling out a form with details like the importer, amount, currency, and due date.
    *   As an **Importer**, I want to view a list of all my invoices, with clear status indicators (Paid, Unpaid, Overdue).
    *   As an **Importer**, I want to pay an invoice using funds from my wallet.
    *   As an **Importer**, I want to be able to pay an invoice by scanning a QR code.

### 3.4. Wallet Management
*   **Description**: A digital wallet system for users to hold and transact funds in multiple currencies.
*   **User Stories**:
    *   As an **Importer/Supplier**, I want to view my wallet balances for different currencies (USD, EUR).
    *   As an **Admin**, I want to be able to credit or debit a user's wallet for administrative purposes (e.g., refunds, initial funding).

### 3.5. Admin Panels

### 3.6. Smart Invoice Tool (AI-Powered)

    *   As a **Supplier**, I want to input data about a customer and transaction to receive an AI-powered suggestion for the invoice amount and payment plan.
    *   As a **Supplier**, I want to understand the reasoning behind the AI's suggestions.

### 3.7. AI Change Tracking System
*   **Description**: A meta-feature for development. A structured documentation system within the codebase to track requirements and tasks.
*   **User Stories**:
    *   As a developer, I want a clear PRD to understand the product vision and goals.
    *   As a developer, I want a task list derived from the PRD to track implementation progress.
    *   As a developer, I want a changelog that documents major AI-driven code changes in a commit-style format to understand the evolution of the codebase.

## 5. UI/UX Guidelines

*   **Principle of Least Astonishment**: The UI should be intuitive and predictable. Users should feel "at home" and navigate with confidence.
*   **Consistency**: Maintain consistent use of colors, typography, spacing, and components across all pages. The existing style guide must be adhered to.
*   **Responsiveness**: All pages and components must be fully responsive and functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
*   **Feedback**: Provide clear and immediate feedback for user actions (e.g., toasts for success/error, loading spinners for asynchronous operations, confirmation dialogs for destructive actions).
*   **Modularity**: Build the UI from small, reusable, single-responsibility components.
